<h1>Designing<br />in<br />Photoshop<br />sucks</h1>
  
<p><em>I’m not saying you can’t design in Photoshop. I certainly used to, and plenty of designers much more talented than myself do. But I’d argue that in 90% of cases, it’s not the best tool for the job. I’ll explain why.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>It’s incredibly common for web designers to use Photoshop as a tool to mock up sites. I get it. It’s quick, simple and visual… but also totally inaccurate.</p>

<p>By designing a web page in Photoshop, you’re creating a fixed-size image for a responsive, “retina-display” world. It’s not a true representation of what you’d actually see on the web. Animation, transitions, accurate/readable fonts and responsive design are all becoming essential in a mobile-focused landscape.</p>

<p>Sure, you can make a couple comps, mock up different breakpoints and so on &mdash; but that’s just making things super complicated.</p>

<p>Personally, I think it’s really important for web designers to <i>design in the browser</i>. Start with a sketch, flesh out all your ideas on paper then jump straight into code.</p>

<hr>

<p>I’ve been taking this approach for the last three or four years, and it really gives you an idea of what can actually be achieved with HTML & CSS. Clients also find a static web page much more impressive than an image, even if it’s super simple.</p>

<p>Sometimes you’ll see mockups and they’ll be impossible (or at least, very complicated) to implement. Web designers now, more than ever, need an in-depth understanding of their medium — otherwise you won’t be able to design effective, functional sites.</p>
